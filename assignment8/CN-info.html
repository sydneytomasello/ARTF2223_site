	On October 1, 1992, Cartoon Network began as a channel to show animated television series for children, and has now grown into one of the forerunners for airing television series. The network’s humble beginnings start with re-runs of Warner Bros cartoons as well as Hanna-Barbera cartoons, bringing characters like Bugs Bunny, Fred Flintstone, and Yogi Bear into homes on a more centralized channel.
<br> <br>
	Soon, Cartoon Network began producing their own animated series, which gave birth to many now iconic and classic cartoons such as Dexter’s Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Adventure Time.
<br><br>
	Today, Cartoon Network continues to produce critically acclaimed animated programming, leading to an expanding age group that views their programs, as well as providing entertainment and inspiration to kids all around the world. Many leading animators in Hollywood (and working at Cartoon Network) tie the beginning of their love for the art back to watching Cartoon Network when they were young.
